    <br>
    <div>
    <p>Bankai refers to a Zanpakutō's second release, and it can usually only be achieved by <i><u>Captain-level Soul Reapers.</u></i> Fans have seen more than a dozen of these Bankai, and they are all extremely powerful, but some are far stronger than others.</p>

  <div><h2><u>ZABIMARU</u></h2></div>
  <div><p>Zabimaru has two heads of intelligent beings within his spirit form. The first head of Zabimaru is a large, white baboon with long, purple markings along his back and arms. The second head is a white snake, which extends from the back of the baboon in the form of a tail with the snake head on the end. Both of these heads have their own consciousness and speak independently of one another, though the snake depends on the baboon for independent movement. Overall, his appearance strongly resembles that of a nue.</p></div>

  <div><h2><u>HYORINMARU </u></h2></div>
  <div><p>Hyōrinmaru's spirit takes the form of a gigantic, ice blue, serpentine ice dragon with large wings and an echoing voice.
    When Hitsugaya's soul was partially Hollowfied by a Shin'eiyaku pill, Hyōrinmaru's appearance changed drastically to that of an enormous Western ice dragon with large wings, thick legs, a dark and muscular stomach, an arching neck with spiked plates running down the back, and a rugged face with teeth overlapping his mouth.</p></div>

He also has tufts of orange hair on his wrists, and wears a white robe as a skirt with no shoes. He has a large, black, dragon-shaped marking which stretches horizontally across his upper chest, and has dark brown eyes with light red markings underneath them.</p></div>

    <h2><u>SENBONZAKURA</u></h2>
    <p>Senbonzakura's physical manifestation takes the form of a tall, light-skinned man with blue eyes and long, dark brown hair, which frames his face with two chest-length bangs and is tied up in the back with a white ribbon in a long ponytail which reaches his lower back. His face is covered by an ornate mask featuring golden teeth, black lips and fangs, a golden protrusion on either side, and a golden headpiece shaped like three cherry blossoms. He wears a long, light purple kimono with white stripes running down the center and sleeves, which is tied at his waist with a long piece of white fabric that hangs down in two long loops in the front. He wears a red-gold pauldron on each shoulder, which are connected by a golden band with strips of red fabric hanging from it and two interweaved strips of red fabric above it. He wears red, elbow-length gauntlets and red greaves.</p>
