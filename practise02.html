  <div><h2>Zabimaru</h2></div>
  <div><p>Zabimaru has two heads of intelligent beings within his spirit form. The first head of Zabimaru is a large, white baboon with long, purple markings along his back and arms. The second head is a white snake, which extends from the back of the baboon in the form of a tail with the snake head on the end. Both of these heads have their own consciousness and speak independently of one another, though the snake depends on the baboon for independent movement. Overall, his appearance strongly resembles that of a nue.</p></div>

    When Hitsugaya's soul was partially Hollowfied by a Shin'eiyaku pill, Hyōrinmaru's appearance changed drastically to that of an enormous Western ice dragon with large wings, thick legs, a dark and muscular stomach, an arching neck with spiked plates running down the back, and a rugged face with teeth overlapping his mouth.</p></div>
